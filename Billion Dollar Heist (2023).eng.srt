1
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,110
It's Friday,

2
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,420
and it is, of course,
the Muslim prayer day.

3
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,510
Everyone's off,
except for the skeleton staff

4
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,640
at the Bangladeshi Bank,

5
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
including Zubair Bin Huda,
who is the duty manager.

6
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,390
He's part of
the elite team of employees

7
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,090
who run
the SWIFT banking system,

8
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,660
which is a highly secure
banking system

9
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,310
that sends money
around the world.

10
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,280
Now, Bin Huda goes,
as he does every day,

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,150
to the SWIFT printer

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,370
to check up on the transactions
from the day before.

13
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,150
There are usually printouts

14
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,420
of transactions
that came in overnight.

15
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,770
The SWIFT software would print
out a ledger every single day,

16
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,950
an audit trace of every single
transaction that occurred

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,690
on paper.

18
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,390
But when they came in
on February 5th morning,

19
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,870
as they usually do,

20
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,740
they found there were
no SWIFT messages at all.

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,000
In fact, the printer's
shut down. It won't work.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,350
They try and turn it on.

23
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,180
Nothing will kick it
back into life.

24
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,140
He assumes it was simply
a technical error,

25
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,190
shrugs, goes home for the night,

26
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,280
comes back in
on Saturday morning

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,500
to check the system again.

28
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,930
The next day,

29
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,160
they somehow manually
get the printer to work.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,460
This deputy head manager
walks in the room,

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,120
the printer starts working, and
these weird messages come out.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,560
The printer
starts spewing out

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,730
all of these transactions,

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,300
including individual requests
to the Fed in New York

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,350
for $1 billion.

36
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,880
At that moment,
it's panic stations.

37
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,230
When I was growing up,
the biggest crime in Britain

38
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,310
ever recorded
was the Great Train Robbery.

39
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,360
It was an extraordinary thing.
They stole about £2.5 million.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,760
That's about $4 million.

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,240
And that story
ran literally for 30 years.

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,760
Four million dollars.

43
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,290
What you're about to hear

44
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,030
is the story of an attempt
to steal...

45
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,510
a billion dollars

46
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,430
It's told by world-leading

47
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,950
cybersecurity and legal experts
and journalists:

48
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,300
the very people
who uncovered the facts

49
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,910
and threaded them together

50
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,480
to reveal how dangerous the
world of cybercrime is today.

51
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,330
So, there are four big threats

52
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,470
to the world
and to the human race.

53
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,600
One of them
we've just experienced,

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,730
that's the pandemic.

55
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,820
Then you've got weapons
of mass destruction.

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,220
You've got climate change.

57
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,960
But barrelling down towards us
before those is cyber.

58
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,930
This is the possibility

59
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,060
of our overdependency
on network technologies

60
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,940
being undermined, either by
malfunctioning of the system...

61
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,590
New problems are emerging

62
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,160
the day after an Amazon
web service outage.

63
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,250
Massive and mysterious,
a global outage...

64
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,210
...or by a targeted attack.

65
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,120
More than a thousand companies

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,300
have been crippled
by this attack so far.

67
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,260
Sounds like we're looking
at a 2022 with more hacks,

68
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,570
more lost money.

69
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,230
So, when I started hunting
hackers in the early 1990s...

70
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,670
our enemy was really simple.

71
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,150
All the malware,
all the viruses,

72
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,110
all the attacks were
done by teenage boys.

73
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,460
What will your parents think?

74
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,810
I've been doing this job
for two decades now.

75
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,470
When we first started,

76
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,900
the people writing viruses
and malware

77
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,470
were doing it for fun,

78
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,390
to get their name in lights,
to say, "Look what I can do."

79
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,650
No flash, please.

80
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,780
When I started analysing
viruses, they looked like this.

81
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,050
Malware was still spread
on floppy disks.

82
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,700
They were spreading at the speed
of people travelling the world

83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,100
and carrying the viruses
with them.

84
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,540
Michelangelo has
proven less harmful than feared.

85
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,100
All the stuff you've got
in there you may really want,

86
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,410
it's just gone?

87
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,450
Then the internet came around,
and suddenly,

88
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,330
malware outbreaks could
go around the world in seconds.

89
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,940
For the last 36 hours,

90
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,680
the ILOVEYOU virus has been
creating havoc around the world.

91
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Experts have reason to worry.
The first attack, July 19th,

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,640
infected about 300,000
systems in nine hours.

93
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,120
First of all, the guys who
make a living doing security

94
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,040
and are trying to protect themselves

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,560
are scared shitless of you,
because you can just ruin 'em.

96
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,870
After the period of time

97
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,520
where hackers
were just doing things for fun,

98
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,010
some of them realised that they
could use it to make money.

99
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,660
Prior to, like, the 2000s...

100
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,710
cyber was primarily around
a disruption of websites...

101
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,890
defacement of a webpage.

102
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,500
Just as we got around 2000,
the dot-com boom, the explosion,

103
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,370
we started into
what would become

104
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,160
financially motivated hackers.

105
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,030
This really flourished,
especially in Eastern European,

106
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,120
Russia, CIS bloc countries.

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,950
This was the time
of gangster capitalism,

108
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,000
when everyone's world in Eastern
Europe was falling apart,

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,610
where organised crime and...

110
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,520
former members of
the intelligence services

111
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,310
were taking hold
of the economy.

112
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,270
So you had a lot of young people
in the 1990s

113
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,930
who were very good
mathematicians, physicists,

114
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,280
computer scientists,

115
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,500
who simply took
the logic and the morality

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,590
of gangster capitalism online.

117
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,160
Virus writers
were writing viruses

118
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,810
to infect Windows computers,

119
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,950
and those computers were then
sold to email spammers,

120
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,950
who were using those machines
to send Viagra spam

121
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,650
or what have you,
basically making money.

122
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,430
And that changed everything.

123
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,570
People at that time
began to use online banking,

124
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,620
and they began to steal people's
online banking credentials,

125
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,270
from there, also get
credit card numbers,

126
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,400
and use that
to basically transfer funds.

127
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,670
Just in hundreds of dollars at
a time from these individuals.

128
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,890
They eventually realised
that going after individuals

129
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,190
was much more difficult

130
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,280
than just going after
the banks themselves.

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,940
Get into databases,

132
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,420
those databases held
credit card numbers.

133
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,600
Take those numbers and then
sell them on the black market.

134
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,340
Originally, the internet
was set up at the Pentagon...

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,000
just to be able to share
resources between computers.

136
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,220
And it was really never
designed to have

137
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,490
banking attached to it,

138
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,710
critical infrastructure
attached to it.

139
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,360
It was really designed
for availability.

140
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,100
It was never designed
for security.

141
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Whereas in the early 1990s

142
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
when there was only 30,000
people connected to it

143
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,810
and several hundred systems,
we've moved to a system

144
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,940
which essentially is the
backbone of global finance.

145
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,560
The fact that
it's able to do that...

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,430
the fact that it's able
to sustain currently between

147
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,390
15 and 20 percent
of GDP globally

148
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,740
tells us something about
just how important

149
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,910
this infrastructure is.

150
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,090
Why did people move
into the internet

151
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,660
to seek economic opportunity?

152
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,620
Because that's where the
economic opportunity was,

153
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,570
untethered by norms,

154
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,790
untethered
by national boundaries,

155
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,490
and essentially limited
only by the creativity

156
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,190
that these individuals had.

157
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,810
The user nagged
the Federal Reserve Bank

158
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,380
with 35 payment instructions
worth $951 million.

159
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,860
We'd just never heard
of such a thing before.

160
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,040
We'd been investigating cybercrime

161
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,560
for a couple of decades
at that point.

162
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,700
You see cyber criminals go in,

163
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,740
and they try to transfer a few
hundred thousands of dollars,

164
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,050
maybe a million,
a couple of million.

165
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,050
But conducting a cyber-attack
to try to steal one billion?

166
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,020
That was an order of magnitude
that we had never seen before.

167
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,670
It was clear from early on

168
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,110
that it was one of the biggest
cyber heists in the world.

169
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,500
When we first started
hearing rumours

170
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,810
about something affecting
SWIFT network,

171
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,420
I didn't understand
how big it was.

172
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,120
But when we started realising

173
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,640
this is at a completely
different scale,

174
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
it just blew my mind.

175
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,440
Once they realised

176
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,570
that the money actually
was really gone,

177
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,620
then the panic began to set in.

178
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,890
They lost $81 million instantly
to a bank in the Philippines.

179
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,980
They see the $81 million
has already gone

180
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,850
and that nearly $900 million
extra has been requested.

181
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,250
They basically try to figure out
what to do next.

182
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,860
They have no idea what to do.

183
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,120
They hunted for ways to contact
the New York Fed.

184
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,650
Desperate calls are made
by them.

185
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,740
And it goes
to an answering machine.

186
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,750
<i>You've reached
the Federal Reserve Bank...</i>

187
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,620
Because it's Saturday
in New York,

188
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,010
and nobody's picking
up the phone.

189
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,100
<i>- Please call back...</i>
- It's a complete shitshow.

190
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,150
Total disorganisation,
at both ends, I would stress.

191
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,240
<i>The New York Times Magazine</i>
was planning a true-crime issue,

192
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,420
and my editor came to me

193
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,900
and asked I was interested
in doing it.

194
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,600
I looked into it a bit.

195
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,120
There definitely were
some intriguing elements,

196
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,770
and made me pay attention.

197
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,430
The Federal Reserve
has pretty much

198
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,170
depended on the SWIFT
banking system,

199
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,870
and since there has rarely
been a hack, if ever,

200
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,830
of the SWIFT banking system...

201
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,050
the Federal Reserve
has never instituted

202
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,800
any sort of 24-7 hotline.

203
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,500
Eventually, they get
hold of somebody at SWIFT,

204
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,150
and SWIFT says,

205
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,760
"Just shut the whole lot down

206
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,500
until we know
what's going on here."

207
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,160
Badrul Khan decides before he
can actually make that decision,

208
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,160
he has to talk to the deputy
governor of the bank,

209
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,820
which he does.

210
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Deputy governor doesn't want to
take the decision upon himself,

211
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,430
so he talks to the governor.
And guess what.

212
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,650
The governor says,
"It's probably a mistake.

213
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,610
We won't shut it down."

214
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,750
Work week begins
at the Bangladesh Bank

215
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,180
on Sunday morning,

216
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,970
and it's then that the general
manager of the bank

217
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,840
comes in and begins to take
stock of what had happened.

218
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,410
They're running out of options.

219
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,110
They're not sure what to do.
Fed is still closed in New York.

220
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,200
They go through
all the SWIFT material,

221
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,070
discover that most of
the money has gone

222
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,200
to the bank in Manila.

223
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,160
And these desperate
messages are sent out:

224
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,600
"Stop the transactions.

225
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,160
Hold that money. Do not
allow it to be withdrawn.

226
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,120
It's our money.
It's been stolen."

227
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,260
But there's a problem.

228
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,210
Five, four,

229
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,130
three, two, one!

230
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,920
Happy New Year!

231
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,790
It's Chinese New Year,

232
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,920
and the Rizal Commercial Bank
is closed.

233
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,190
The thieves chose
a sequence of days...

234
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,630
from Friday, Saturday,
Sunday and Monday,

235
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,810
when one or another
of the three countries

236
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,550
that would be communicating
with one another

237
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,160
was shut down for a holiday.

238
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,610
You've got to hand it
to these guys.

239
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,000
They knew it.

240
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,700
They knew that if they did it
over that weekend,

241
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,960
with the Friday,
the Muslim holiday,

242
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,180
the Sunday and the Saturday,
everything closed in New York,

243
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,530
and the Monday,
Chinese New Year.

244
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,110
They've got four days
to get the heist done.

245
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,370
This is really classy planning.

246
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,420
In that respect,
it was really an ingenious plan.

247
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,420
It's kind of like a great film
director in a malevolent way,

248
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,080
planning out, you know,
a very complex film.

249
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,130
The country of Bangladesh

250
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,870
is the 170th poorest country
in the world.

251
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,260
One billion dollars
is huge to them.

252
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,350
When we talk
about cyber-attacks,

253
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,050
they're not just zeros and ones.

254
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,180
We're not just talking
about people

255
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,750
moving around zeros and ones,
deleting zeros and ones.

256
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,100
One billion dollars
to Bangladesh

257
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,540
potentially means that people
starve in the country.

258
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,240
These things have potential
serious repercussions.

259
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,200
The Bangladesh Bank
heist was significant

260
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,290
because it showed how fragile
global banking was as a whole.

261
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,260
Banks don't just operate
as single isolated entities.

262
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,780
They're part of a system.

263
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,480
And that system is vulnerable.

264
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,400
The US Federal Reserve holds
trillions of dollars in accounts

265
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,570
kept by central banks
all around the world.

266
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,270
Its computer security systems
are state of the art, making it

267
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,580
one of the most difficult
financial institutions to hack.

268
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,550
The criminals realise
that it can't get into

269
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,070
the network system of the Fed,

270
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,900
but the Fed has to talk
to other central banks

271
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,770
around the world,

272
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,390
and this is
where they find a flaw.

273
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,430
The criminals turn
their attention

274
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,440
to the banks'
communication systems.

275
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,400
Every day, the Fed places
thousands of transactions

276
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,050
on behalf of the central banks
that hold US dollar reserves

277
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,320
at the Fed.

278
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,750
The Federal Reserve
has pretty much depended

279
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,100
on the SWIFT banking system

280
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,060
to get its instructions
about transfers.

281
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,020
SWIFT sends money
around the world

282
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,940
to thousands of member banks.

283
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,940
It's the main way that banks
dispatch money to one another.

284
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,600
SWIFT allows you
to transfer money

285
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,770
from one bank to another,

286
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,560
no matter where you are
in the world.

287
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,340
Make international
wire transfers.

288
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,560
The whole banking system
is integrated,

289
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,650
and they depend
above all else on SWIFT,

290
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:21,140
the international transaction
mechanisms, to work.

291
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,310
What it means is,
all it takes

292
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,800
is a single weak link
to bring down the whole network.

293
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,370
So although the target
is the Fed,

294
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,720
they are looking for a bank
with which the Fed communicates,

295
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,330
which holds a lot
of its reserves in New York.

296
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,120
But it's a long way away,

297
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,560
in a distant time zone
from the Fed,

298
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,300
and it's likely to have

299
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,390
patchy security systems in place
in its computer network.

300
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,790
My colleagues in Dhaka,

301
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,010
they were chasing it
for a long time.

302
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,450
It was a robbery of a scale
that we hadn't heard of.

303
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,580
The first thought
that came to my mind was,

304
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,630
because it was the
Bangladeshi Central Bank,

305
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,240
I thought the hackers found it

306
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,540
somehow easier to target it.

307
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,370
Because it was Bangladesh,

308
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,420
I suspected they would
be more vulnerable

309
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,770
to cyber-attacks as such.

310
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,340
"Hmm. A Bangladeshi bank.

311
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,990
Probably doesn't have
the same level of security

312
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,210
and if they do,
it's probably one or two people,

313
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,220
not a team of 6,000
working on it.

314
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,350
Let's go for it."

315
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,660
These attackers
weren't just skilled

316
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,920
in breaching networks,

317
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,830
figuring out how
to get into an organisation.

318
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,010
They had to study that
SWIFT software deeply.

319
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,190
This attack happened
well before that February 5th,

320
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,840
when the bank employee walked in

321
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,890
and saw that printer hadn't
printed out the audit jobs

322
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,930
and couldn't figure out
what was going on.

323
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,810
This attack started more
than a year prior to that.

324
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,290
These attackers had been
working for months

325
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,120
in the build-up until that day.

326
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,250
It is a mistake
for people to think

327
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,560
that this was something
that happened overnight.

328
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,640
It is a mistake
for people to think

329
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,950
that this happened in a month,
or two months or three months.

330
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,390
It is a slow,
methodical approach,

331
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,520
because it's a business,
all right? You build it.

332
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,140
Bank robberies used to be
something that happened

333
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,490
in the real world.

334
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,630
Now they only happen
in the online world.

335
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,760
If you would try to steal
$100 million in banknotes,

336
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,160
that would be, like,
ten trucks full of notes.

337
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,510
If you drive ten trucks
full of notes out of the bank,

338
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,030
someone would notice.

339
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,290
But when you do the same thing
online, no one notices anything.

340
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,040
Every movie you've ever seen
of them breaking into a bank

341
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,430
is them doing it
over a bank holiday

342
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,390
or something of that nature.

343
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,220
Same concept here.

344
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,360
This isn't Matthew Broderick
sitting in front of a computer,

345
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,450
like <i>War Games</i>
back in the 1980s,

346
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,320
some kid in their basement.

347
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,370
These are
criminal organisations.

348
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,020
Each person has a skill set.

349
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,070
It's kind of like that
<i>Ocean's Eleven</i>-type thing.

350
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,070
You know,
"This guy could crack the bank,

351
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,330
this guy could do
the surveillance cameras,

352
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,770
this is the getaway,
this is the conman."

353
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,550
You all have a role to play,

354
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,300
and you need everybody
to execute their role

355
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,080
to the best of their abilities

356
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,870
for you to be
successful and get it out.

357
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,000
So how do you pull off
a heist of this magnitude?

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,310
It takes the right crew of
highly skilled specialists.

359
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:03,190
And it all starts not with ones
and zeros, but with people.

360
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,590
Cybercrime is about
gaining credentials

361
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,630
to gain access,

362
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,420
stealing the keys.

363
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,810
The social engineer
is critical to a hack.

364
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,250
It's how you get in,
and you get in

365
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,380
not through digital means,
you get in through human means.

366
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,950
It's to do with psychology.

367
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,520
The criminals have to ensnare
one of the employees

368
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,050
of the Bangladeshi Bank,

369
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,880
beginning by going through
their social media profiles

370
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,710
and looking
for suitable targets.

371
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,930
Our relationship
with the computer

372
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,840
is one of perceived intimacy;

373
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,370
that when we're using
a computer,

374
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,760
no one else can see
what we're doing, we believe,

375
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,370
and it's just us and the screen.

376
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,810
And if we were to read
an email from a friend,

377
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,900
we tend to believe it
at face value.

378
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,210
They found
close to three dozen employees.

379
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,830
And they constructed
a simple spear-phish email:

380
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,740
an email message that pretended
to be from a guy

381
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,440
named Rasal Alam.

382
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,050
And Rasal Alam said,

383
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,580
"Hey, I just wanna
work at your company.

384
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,410
Here's a résumé attached.
Have a look."

385
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,100
And it turned out
that they mailed that

386
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,890
to about 36 different employees,
and three of them

387
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,720
opened that attachment
connected to that email.

388
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,330
It was a zip file,

389
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,640
and the zip file contained
just a document inside.

390
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,290
They opened up the document
and it was his résumé.

391
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,730
It was a résumé for Rasel Ahlam,
who wanted to work at the bank,

392
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,990
but unbeknownst
to those individuals,

393
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,820
also contained
malicious code inside.

394
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,740
We can look at any data breach,

395
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,220
and the root cause
has either been

396
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,310
a technical problem

397
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,400
or a people problem.

398
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,220
And the technical problems
can be really hard

399
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,530
and really expensive
and really slow to fix,

400
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,580
but at least we can fix them.

401
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,150
But in the end, we have
no patch for human brains.

402
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,240
There's no way to fix the people
who do stupid mistakes.

403
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,720
When attackers try to send

404
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,030
these spear-phishing emails,
they try to do two things.

405
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,510
They try to look very normal.
It was just a résumé.

406
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,810
They try to fly under the radar,

407
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,510
to look as legitimate
as possible.

408
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,470
And the second is they often
try to use enticing techniques.

409
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,050
New dangers tonight from
the Love Bug computer virus,

410
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,960
this time disguised
as a friendlier email.

411
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,570
The first internet virus
that went around the world

412
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,880
in less than 48 hours was
called the ILOVEYOU virus.

413
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,490
And already,
business interruption costs

414
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,670
are estimated at more than
a billion dollars.

415
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,590
You would be sitting
there working away,

416
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,500
and then suddenly,
in your inbox,

417
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,550
you get an email which says,
"I love you."

418
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,250
And it could well be
that this is a person

419
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,820
who you've always
held a torch for.

420
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,340
And so, of course,
you're very excited,

421
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,080
and you press on the link,
and then you're doomed.

422
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,870
What happens is,
the virus infects your machine

423
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,960
and proceeds to email everyone
you've ever emailed.

424
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,610
The end result of that
is the mail servers

425
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,700
get bogged down,

426
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,140
and the only way
to solve the problem

427
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,270
is to shut the servers down,
hence the interruption.

428
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,320
The ILOVEYOU virus
was one of the first viruses

429
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,060
that had really
worldwide impact.

430
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,720
It was still a virus
written by a guy

431
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,590
that just wanted to get
his name in lights.

432
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,810
He wanted to see his virus

433
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,590
travel around the world
a little bit

434
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,380
and maybe get
in the news somewhere,

435
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,810
and then him be able to say,
"Oh, I wrote that."

436
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,080
Mr de Guzman hardly
seemed to comprehend the chaos

437
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,040
inflicted on
the world's computers.

438
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,610
But what happened was, it
spread so quickly and so fast,

439
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,260
it brought down email
all over the world,

440
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,920
and having email go down
was monumental.

441
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,350
Experts say that the ILOVEYOU
virus could end up costing

442
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,580
the world economy $10 billion
in lost work time.

443
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,620
It became the first sign to show
that we relied on the internet.

444
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,190
The internet was the basis for
our financial transactions,

445
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,150
for the way we do business.

446
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,630
I would talk to people

447
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,330
and remind them
and educate them and say,

448
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,890
"Look, you can't just click

449
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,380
on any attachment
that comes to you in an email."

450
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,810
I remember talking to a guy
about the Anna Kournikova virus

451
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,990
that purported to be nude
pictures of Anna Kournikova.

452
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,950
And he told me, he said,
"Yeah, I knew it was a virus.

453
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,080
I thought it was probably
a virus. But what if it wasn't?

454
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,960
What if it really was
nude pictures?

455
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,780
So I double-clicked on it."

456
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,390
People just don't realise

457
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,050
what clicking on that
attachment means.

458
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,100
Cyber criminals and hackers
realised a long time ago

459
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,010
that your username and password,

460
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,800
particularly to
your email account,

461
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,280
could get them into your
stock brokerage account,

462
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,200
to your online
banking account,

463
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,900
to send phishing emails
to other contacts.

464
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,990
If you protect
yourself properly,

465
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,210
the chances are
you won't be a victim

466
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,210
of what one would call
"drive-by hacking".

467
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,480
If, however, you're being
specifically targeted

468
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,960
by a hacking group,
they will follow that trace.

469
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,530
And they will get you.

470
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,280
Now, we know that at least three
members of the Bangladeshi Bank

471
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,580
were targeted by this after
the social engineer

472
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,980
had scanned
all of their social media,

473
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,720
and at least three of them

474
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,070
opened the letter
and took the bait.

475
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,240
Once that code
began executing

476
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,290
on those bank employees'
computers,

477
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,900
it would reach out back
to the attackers

478
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,860
and tell them that
these machines are now infected

479
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,300
and give them full control,

480
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,040
as if they were sitting
in front of the keyboard,

481
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,130
just like those employees.

482
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,740
There was malware
in the system

483
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,570
that was actually
copying screenshots,

484
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,450
copying keystrokes of employees,
and no one knew.

485
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,800
They've got
their foot in the door.

486
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,760
This is the essential
first step.

487
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,670
The first layer of security
has been breached.

488
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,330
And the digger, the person who
is getting deeper and deeper

489
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,550
into the computer network,

490
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,250
has to be a very
advanced hacker.

491
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,950
This is when you need
a real professional.

492
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,650
They're like ghosts.
Nobody can see them,

493
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,000
but they're mapping every
single bit of that network.

494
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,570
In the Bank of Bangladesh,

495
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,140
you had computers that are all
interconnected to each other,

496
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,270
and they're connected
using what's called a switch.

497
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,020
In your average bank, that has
a good security program,

498
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,670
those switches are
what's called segmented.

499
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,590
So each of those switches
only allow

500
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,290
a certain number of computers
to talk to each other

501
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,810
rather than every computer
to talk to each other.

502
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,380
But in the case of
the Bank of Bangladesh,

503
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,550
in the back-office network, they
were using these very cheap,

504
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,080
literally $10 switches
that didn't do any segmentation.

505
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,340
Every computer was potentially
connected to each other.

506
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,300
Basically,
it's a cost-cutting exercise.

507
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,530
But that cost-cutting exercise
was what the digger needed.

508
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,480
Those attackers
began to do

509
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,230
what we call a lateral traverse
across the network,

510
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,140
search for other computers
to infect,

511
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,060
look for credentials.

512
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,840
Whenever you log
into a computer,

513
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,670
your credentials are cached.

514
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,330
They're put into the memory
of the computer.

515
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,290
Attackers are able
to filter through that memory

516
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,640
and find used usernames
and passwords.

517
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,460
They don't always know
what they're for,

518
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,380
so they try to collect as many
credentials as they can

519
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,430
and see, "What computers can
I see from this computer?",

520
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,600
and just begin to use them
over and over again

521
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,650
and just try them.

522
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,610
Eventually, they hop on

523
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,050
and are able to connect
to another computer.

524
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,310
They get onto that one.

525
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,270
It's still not what
they're interested in,

526
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,660
but they're able to find more
usernames and passwords

527
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,400
and try those
on all the other computers

528
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,190
they can see
from that advantage point.

529
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,020
That's how they move across
the network over and over again.

530
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,540
They would delete
all traces of themselves

531
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,890
as they moved
across the network,

532
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,630
ultimately jumping from
computer to computer

533
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,680
until they found
the SWIFT terminal,

534
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,810
their ultimate goal in order
to make wire transfers

535
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,810
out of the Bank of Bangladesh.

536
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,770
It takes a long time.

537
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,170
They're there for months.
This is an ongoing process.

538
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,220
If at any moment they're
discovered to be in there,

539
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,130
then the whole
operation is finished.

540
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,050
With the Bangladeshi Bank heist,

541
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,270
you basically have two
operations running in parallel.

542
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,670
You have an offline operation
going on,

543
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,230
which is to do with
the money laundering.

544
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,940
It's the fence's responsibility

545
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,900
to set up
the recipient accounts.

546
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,380
They're gonna end up
with cold, hard cash,

547
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,080
and they need individuals
on the ground

548
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,900
to pick up that cash
and move it.

549
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,430
And so, in May of 2015,

550
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,870
before they'd even got
into the SWIFT terminal,

551
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,650
they were able to recruit
a Chinese individual

552
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,310
to go to the Philippines and
open up four bank accounts there

553
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,220
at a bank called RCBC.

554
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,880
You have to make sure
those people inside the bank

555
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,710
in the Philippines

556
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,970
have been properly corrupted

557
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,670
and properly instructed
as to what their role is.

558
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,060
The fence opens up
these accounts,

559
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,590
puts $500 in each of them,

560
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,720
and then they just go to sleep
for nine months.

561
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,950
These attackers were
inside the Bank of Bangladesh

562
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,820
for a full year,
which is incredible.

563
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,260
They actually got
onto that SWIFT terminal

564
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,780
exactly one year later...

565
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,220
on January 29th, 2016.

566
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,010
In any bank,
you have different employees.

567
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,410
You have back-office employees,
administrative employees,

568
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,330
but you also have computers
that are connected

569
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,150
directly to
financial transactions.

570
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,070
And only users who have specific
access to those machines

571
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,550
are allowed to use them.

572
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,030
When we talk about the case of
the Bank of Bangladesh,

573
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,600
there was a single computer
that had credentials

574
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,080
from a shared employee.

575
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,210
You had an employee that
would use that SWIFT terminal,

576
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,830
but also had their own computer
in the normal back-office area.

577
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,350
Once they got onto
that employee's computer,

578
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,050
they were able to jump across.

579
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,960
They waited. They basically
did a recon on the system.

580
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,570
They crawled around.

581
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,750
They looked and tried to fully
understand how this worked,

582
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,800
how SWIFT worked, how each bank
employee would make a request

583
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,150
into the SWIFT system,
where it would go,

584
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,240
how to direct that to branches

585
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,110
where they had set up
these accounts.

586
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,720
And in this case, it was just
very simple and very clever.

587
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,340
The thief is
not so much someone

588
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,300
who is physically
taking out the money

589
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,690
and stuffing it into a bag.

590
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,610
They're making sure

591
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,570
that every bit on the system
is coordinated.

592
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,220
There are all sorts of things
to get right

593
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,490
before that fatal moment
when the request is made.

594
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,100
Everything has to be

595
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,710
really, really
precisely coordinated

596
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,930
to get all the timing right.
You've got four days.

597
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,540
You can't afford a slip-up.

598
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,330
When the attackers
got into the SWIFT terminal

599
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,720
on January 29th of 2016,
they paused for about five days

600
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,070
to get their malicious
software ready

601
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,160
that allowed them
to cover their tracks

602
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,250
when they were on
that SWIFT terminal.

603
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,170
They decided to wait
until February 4th.

604
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,820
And this is no accident.

605
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,700
They have chosen
a long weekend

606
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,570
due to holidays in different
parts of the world.

607
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,180
That means,
instead of the usual two days

608
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,530
they have to get away with it

609
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,840
before alarms
start going off everywhere,

610
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,930
they've got four days.
It's brilliant.

611
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,930
February 4th, 2016,
was a Thursday.

612
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,630
That's the last day of
the working week in Bangladesh.

613
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,940
In Bangladesh, they work
from Sunday to Thursday.

614
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,420
So, at some point late
in the afternoon,

615
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,680
the SWIFT transaction operator
in the Bangladeshi Bank

616
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
logs off his terminal.

617
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,470
But three hours later,

618
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,430
the thief logs into
that terminal

619
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,820
and starts to impersonate him.

620
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,910
They logged into that SWIFT
terminal at 8:36 p.m.,

621
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,050
after they believed,
or really knew,

622
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,400
that all the bank employees
had gone home for the weekend.

623
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,230
And they put forward
35 different wire transactions

624
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,280
from that SWIFT terminal,
totalling $951 million,

625
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,630
almost $1 billion,
completely unheard of.

626
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,020
Ten hours
behind Bangladesh,

627
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,810
New York is waking up.

628
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,250
The first thing
that the Fed sees

629
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,290
is 35 requests

630
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,210
for almost the entire holdings
of the Bangladeshi Bank.

631
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,520
Usually, it's figures of sort
of $300,000, $500,000.

632
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
They want almost a billion!

633
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,740
The operator, perhaps
unsurprisingly, rejects it,

634
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,480
sends it back to Bangladesh.

635
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,750
But he rejects it not because

636
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,580
this is an absolutely crazy
amount of money,

637
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,580
but because the requests
are wrongly formatted.

638
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,150
As much research
that they had done,

639
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,850
they didn't really understand
how to fill out

640
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,330
those SWIFT transfers.

641
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,940
They were missing what's called
an intermediate bank.

642
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,160
New York Federal Reserve
replied to them,

643
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,460
via the SWIFT system,
back to their computer

644
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,680
that they were sitting
in front of, virtually,

645
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,470
saying, "Hey, these transactions
are missing information."

646
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,520
They think on their feet.

647
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,820
They reformat the requests,
send them back...

648
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,000
and hold their breath
to see what happens.

649
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,570
They ultimately corrected
34 of them.

650
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,870
They had forgotten one.

651
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,230
The one did have
the intermediate bank

652
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,440
went to Deutsche Bank.

653
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,580
That order was for $20 million

654
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,800
to a charity called the Shalika
Foundation in Sri Lanka.

655
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,100
But they had made
a typo as well,

656
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,410
and they had misspelled
"foundation" as "fandation".

657
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,680
And so Deutsche Bank
saw that typo

658
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,850
and questioned it and, again,

659
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,290
held that transaction
due to that typo.

660
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,860
We use that
as the poster child

661
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,080
for why you need
to learn how to spell.

662
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,780
Otherwise, you can lose
$20 million.

663
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,260
Ultimately, when
they return the other 34...

664
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,260
Bingo.

665
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,480
The operator approves them.

666
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,790
Four of them went through.

667
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,490
The green light is given.
The heist is on.

668
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,620
Those four went through
to those bank accounts

669
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,060
in the Philippines
that had been opened

670
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,580
more than six months earlier.

671
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,630
And they were able
to transfer out $81 million

672
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,630
to the bank in the Philippines.

673
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,830
Ultimately, they were about
to transfer $1 billion

674
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,530
from the Bank of Bangladesh,

675
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,490
but they didn't want
anyone to find out.

676
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,450
They began to cover
their tracks.

677
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,200
Normally, as a bank employee,

678
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,070
you'll load up
the SWIFT software,

679
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,940
you'll see on the screen
all the latest transactions,

680
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,590
you can make transactions.

681
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,340
And so the attackers deleted all
records of those transactions.

682
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,560
But it's not just digital.

683
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,000
In the world of finance,
everything must be a hard copy.

684
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And the attackers
knew that as well.

685
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,620
Every SWIFT transaction
that takes place

686
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,970
is immediately printed out
locally in the Bangladeshi Bank.

687
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,970
So that printer cannot
be working

688
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,670
when the heist is going on.

689
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,540
The attackers hijacked
all of those print jobs,

690
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,420
replaced all of those
print jobs with zeros

691
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,550
so that nothing would
come out of the printer.

692
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,510
Now, the other 30
wire transactions sat around.

693
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,860
And, ultimately,
the attackers waited,

694
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,260
and they waited...

695
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,870
And they logged out at
3:59 a.m. Bangladesh time.

696
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,440
Potentially, they thought
that in New York,

697
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,090
the business day ended
at five p.m.,

698
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,920
and they weren't gonna hear
any more.

699
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,880
The New York Fed
had actually stopped

700
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,440
the rest of the transactions,

701
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,930
because the address for
the bank in the Philippines

702
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,800
was on Jupiter Street.
J-U-P-I-T-E-R.

703
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,850
Right, now this is when
the story gets really weird.

704
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,850
In a totally unrelated incident
two years earlier,

705
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,460
we have a Greek shipping
magnate, Dimitris Cambis,

706
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,030
and he is buying eight tankers.

707
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,250
What Dimitris knew,
but not many other people,

708
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,870
was that the money
for these eight oil tankers

709
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,910
came from Iran,

710
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,660
and Iran was under US sanctions.

711
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,350
Someone in the US
caught wind of the fact

712
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,710
that the Iranians were
financing Mr Cambis.

713
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,010
His company was put on
the sanctions watch list,

714
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,320
and his company
was called Jupiter Seaways.

715
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,590
It was just their bad luck

716
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,200
that they designated
the money transfers

717
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,330
to go to the Jupiter branch
of the Rizal Bank in Manila.

718
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,210
As the transfers were being sent
out from the New York Reserve

719
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,990
to the Philippines,

720
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,950
the Jupiter name was caught
by the computer system.

721
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,910
It halted these transactions.

722
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,480
The Fed had to take
a second look.

723
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,790
They stopped it
because they realised,

724
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,180
"Wait, we have somewhere
in the order 35 transactions

725
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,220
coming from
the Bank of Bangladesh,

726
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,400
adding up to $1 billion?
You know, this isn't usual."

727
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,060
So they held them
and sent a message back,

728
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,890
asking for confirmation.

729
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,760
Had the attackers waited
just one more hour,

730
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,590
they could have replied to them
via the SWIFT system,

731
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,200
saying these transactions
were not a mistake.

732
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,290
Ultimately,
the Bank of Bangladesh

733
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,250
might have lost
much, much more.

734
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,340
So far, they managed
to get $81 million.

735
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,430
But, boy, did they come close
to hitting the jackpot.

736
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,650
Just under $1 billion

737
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,570
was very, very nearly
stolen from this bank.

738
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,190
The next day,
the bank employees came in,

739
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,580
and the printer wasn't working,

740
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,930
because they installed
their malicious code

741
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,720
to prevent that from happening.

742
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,630
Ultimately,
those bank employees

743
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,900
didn't get it fixed
until February 6,

744
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,550
which would have been a Sunday.

745
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,290
When the printer started,
all these messages came out,

746
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,900
messages from the Fed asking,

747
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,040
"What are these 30 transactions?
Did you mean to make these?"

748
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,300
That triggered
the Bank of Bangladesh

749
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,000
to realise something
had gone wrong.

750
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,650
It was very clear
that they were in deep,

751
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,350
such that the bank manager...
This is the Bank of Bangladesh,

752
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,530
the federal bank, the national
bank of the country,

753
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,100
did not notify the leaders,

754
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,230
the government of Bangladesh.
He kept it under wraps.

755
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,540
He notified someone he knew
who knew about security.

756
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,370
"Get on a plane,
get to Bangladesh.

757
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,940
I need you to look at
these computer systems."

758
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,940
Initially, the governor
and his whole team

759
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,160
were quite perplexed.

760
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,340
They didn't quite know
what had happened.

761
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,210
So they thought that
some money had been routed

762
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,040
to a wrong account;
it would come back.

763
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,920
I get this strange phone call
from the governor's office

764
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,700
asking me if I would
drop everything

765
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,270
and come to Dhaka, Bangladesh.

766
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,230
So I assembled a team...

767
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,890
and we flew down.

768
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,590
When we arrived there, we met
with the Bangladesh Bank team.

769
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,120
And that's when I discovered
all the horrifying details

770
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,470
of what had actually happened.

771
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,210
They decide,
"Let's look at the CCTV.

772
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,390
What's that going to tell us?"

773
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,300
There were eight
hours' worth of tapes

774
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,130
that had to be gone through.

775
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,050
Your gut instinct is,
you have a malicious insider.

776
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,700
A physical person had to go in,

777
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,840
log into that machine
and try to make these transfers,

778
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,710
because this attack
hadn't happened before.

779
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,630
They had a SWIFT room,
which was locked.

780
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,930
And typically when
the SWIFT operators

781
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,720
needed to do something on SWIFT,
they had to go into the room,

782
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,460
sit in that chair and terminal,

783
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,030
and there was only
one shadow we could find.

784
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,770
We eventually decided
it was the person

785
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,390
sweeping the place after hours.

786
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,310
They were saying, "How could
somebody process the transaction

787
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,960
when there was nobody there?"

788
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,570
I mean, even after the payment
instructions had been sent,

789
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,400
they had no idea for a very long
time what was happening.

790
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,410
They didn't think it was a hack.
They had no traces of a hack.

791
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,630
But they watched eight hours of
that footage over that weekend

792
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,630
and realised there was
no one at that computer.

793
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,940
Nothing.

794
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,240
They had no idea that
the Bank of Bangladesh

795
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,850
had been breached by hackers.

796
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,380
Only after we see these things
happen over and over again,

797
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,170
we realise that cyber
has such capabilities.

798
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,440
Bangladesh was a bit of
a bombshell for all of us.

799
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,090
Hackers and most cybercrime,

800
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,050
it's like smash-and-grab crime.

801
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,490
Quickly grab something
and monetise it

802
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,100
as swiftly as you can.

803
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,230
You know, storm a bank
with shotguns, blow a safe,

804
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,970
fill some bags with cash.

805
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,020
Cybercrime...

806
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,410
It doesn't lend itself well
to long conspiracy

807
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,850
and lots of investigation
and investment

808
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,590
into understanding your target.

809
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,900
I mean, you couldn't
do Bangladesh

810
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,030
unless you really understood
the internal workings

811
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,900
of the central bank
and all the actors involved.

812
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,600
That's not something
that freelance hackers

813
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,820
really are good at.

814
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,910
That requires a level of
investment into resources

815
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,090
and frankly intelligence
that has to be sustained.

816
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,010
To organise something
of that complexity

817
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,840
and for it not to be noticed

818
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,530
by the intelligence agencies
of the state

819
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,020
where that is being planned

820
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,280
would be very,
very difficult indeed.

821
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,410
These hackers went in
and looked at the zeros and ones

822
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,720
in the software
and reverse engineered it,

823
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,380
turned it back into
understandable code.

824
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,900
That's not something
that happens overnight.

825
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,380
It was pretty clear

826
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,860
that this isn't just
normal criminals.

827
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,120
This has to be something bigger.

828
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,960
Once attackers have gained
access to their target network,

829
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,000
they want to stay undetected.

830
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,960
And we've seen many
interesting examples

831
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,010
of how exactly this is done.

832
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,800
What exactly happened

833
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,190
at the Natanz nuclear facility
last week?

834
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,800
It's a question people in Iran
around the world

835
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,460
have been asking
since a fire was reported

836
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,850
at Iran's main uranium
enrichment facility on Thursday.

837
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,900
We're used to Trojans
and viruses on the internet,

838
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,330
but this is the first worm

839
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,900
designed to damage
the physical world.

840
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,040
In 2010, attackers created
a piece of malicious software

841
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,350
that was designed to infiltrate
Iran's nuclear programme,

842
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,000
to get into their centrifuges,

843
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,050
in particular,
get onto computers

844
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,920
that controlled
their centrifuges.

845
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,140
Iran says it will
retaliate against any country

846
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,880
that conducts cyber-attacks
on its nuclear sites.

847
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,530
The intention
was to spin the centrifuges

848
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,150
of Iran's nuclear capabilities
out of control,

849
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,150
make the centrifuges explode

850
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,410
and push them ten years back

851
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,370
in the uranium enrichment programme.

852
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,720
As a piece of malware,

853
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,760
it was 40 times larger
than any piece of malware

854
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,330
that had ever been
encountered before.

855
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,510
It would have taken
the most advanced,

856
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,990
brilliant computer engineers

857
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,080
years and years of human
working hours

858
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,950
to produce this.

859
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,080
Why was it so big?

860
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,310
Because it needed
to cover itself up.

861
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,790
The attackers
were actually recording

862
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:52,320
the network traffic,
the normal network traffic,

863
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,060
and then playing it back
to the sensors

864
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,840
when they started modifying the
operations of the centrifuges

865
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,720
they were trying to break.

866
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,900
This is the equivalent of,
in the real world,

867
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,900
recording the CCTV footage
from a security camera

868
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,160
and then playing it back
to the camera

869
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,120
when you're doing
something bad.

870
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,300
That's what Stuxnet was doing.

871
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,040
And in the Bangladesh heist,

872
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,210
they were doing
something similar.

873
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,870
Once they made
their transactions,

874
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,310
they wanted to make sure no one
realised they had happened.

875
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,050
They were actually falsifying
the information

876
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,570
about transactions.

877
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,400
The recording of the
transactions were being done

878
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,970
both in electronic format,

879
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,540
but also falsifying the data
being sent to the printers,

880
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,020
which actually looked like
everything was fine.

881
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,240
So you find out how
you're being tracked,

882
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,980
and then you try
to cover your tracks.

883
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,240
Stuxnet did that.

884
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,770
The Bangladeshi heist
did it as well.

885
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,950
Once that money
arrived in the Philippines,

886
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,510
they needed to change
that money into cold, hard cash.

887
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,910
Right now, it's still in
digital ones and zeros,

888
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,430
just a transaction that said
the money has moved

889
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,820
from the Bank of Bangladesh

890
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,090
to these accounts at RCBC.
Four accounts.

891
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,530
The thieves had to
get it out of the Philippines,

892
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,620
make it disappear.

893
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,450
So how were they going
to do that?

894
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,840
There is one industry
in the Philippines

895
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,230
where there is absolutely
no oversight,

896
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,240
where it's a cash-only business.
There are no records, no names.

897
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,110
That is the casino industry.

898
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,250
When we talk about
laundering funds,

899
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,950
we're talking about
taking dirty, illicit funds,

900
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,480
running them through
a legal business

901
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,040
so that if I came
to you and said,

902
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,400
"Hey, where'd you get
that $81 million?",

903
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,310
you could have a paper trail
to show that you won it back.

904
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,100
The hard part
is not stealing the money.

905
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,620
The hard part is moving the
money into a form you can use

906
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,150
without getting caught.

907
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,200
And one method we've seen
for quite a while is gambling.

908
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,070
It was very clear that,

909
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,250
if, at all, there was a place
for you to do that,

910
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,160
it would have been
the Philippines,

911
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,030
because the casinos
are not regulated at all.

912
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,300
It's like a lot of
high-flying gamblers

913
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,300
who'd kind of fly to Manila,

914
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,050
crowd these numerous casinos
in Manila,

915
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,390
lots of money coming in.

916
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,310
People don't question
that kind of money.

917
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,790
I mean, you know...

918
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,750
"Well, as long as
it's coming to us,

919
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,880
we don't bother too much
about where it is coming from."

920
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,280
The thieves knew
if they could get that money

921
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,540
into the casinos,
it would essentially be lost.

922
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,110
What happened was,

923
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,420
the manager from
the Philippines bank,

924
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,380
she was the one who'd opened
those four accounts

925
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,550
using fraudulent IDs.

926
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,950
She got the money withdrawn from
the bank in the Philippines.

927
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,950
From there, it started to go

928
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,560
through something
called Philrem.

929
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,000
It's a bit like a Western Union
in the Philippines,

930
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,180
transferred into pesos.

931
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,480
I don't know
if you've ever used

932
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,010
Philippine pesos before,

933
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:28,050
but that's one hell
of a lot of pesos, $22 million.

934
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:33,450
In fact,
it's over one million banknotes.

935
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,630
They actually had
to request that cash

936
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,980
to come from a sister
branch location,

937
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,850
that arrived in boxes.

938
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,420
The bank manager was seen by
one of the other bank employees

939
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,590
collecting those boxes
and literally going outside

940
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,860
and loading them up
into a Lexus.

941
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,340
And that money
was driven away.

942
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,700
So, we're talking stacks
of bills carried in vans

943
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,220
to the Solaire Casino
right by the airport.

944
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,440
It allows the Chinese gamblers
to come off the plane.

945
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,320
Five minutes, they're on
the floor playing baccarat.

946
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,970
The money goes to this place.
It's wheeled in wheelbarrows

947
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:24,110
across the casino floor
up to this guarded escalator.

948
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,210
There's so much
physical cash involved,

949
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,300
they've enlisted their
own crew of gamblers

950
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,830
to launder the stolen funds.

951
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,090
And they just played baccarat,

952
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,610
all day long.

953
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,140
They had individuals,

954
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,230
mostly appeared to be Chinese
nationals that they had,

955
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,530
I assume, hired to take
those funds and launder them.

956
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:01,490
You change that cash
into casino chips,

957
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,150
play a few games,

958
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,930
cash in the chips.

959
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:10,590
And when you get that cash back,
that is then laundered.

960
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,110
And this wouldn't
have been unusual.

961
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,510
This was the Chinese lunar week.

962
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,290
That would've been very common
for individuals,

963
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,560
high rollers, to come
into the Philippines

964
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,860
and play at the casinos
during that time.

965
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,610
Spending $22 million in
a casino over a weekend,

966
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,560
let's face it, could be fun.

967
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,700
Doing this story
and trying to figure out

968
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,400
where in history
to sort of place this thing.

969
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,320
Was this the biggest
heist of all time?

970
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,320
No, but it certainly looked
to be the biggest cyber heist

971
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,240
of a bank in history.

972
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,370
And over the next few days,
I just remember

973
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:58,420
calling up my sources
at Symantec

974
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,990
and a couple other
cybersecurity firms

975
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,250
and getting in touch with
a guy named Eric Chien.

976
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,130
We have all kinds of
sensors sitting on networks

977
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,780
and computers
all over the world.

978
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,130
Any time some sort of
cyber criminal, some attacker,

979
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,050
is trying to breach a computer,
they're leaving traces behind.

980
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,530
Every attack
has a signature.

981
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,100
If you look at it long enough,

982
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,450
if you study it,
if you work it long enough,

983
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,710
you can understand
the way they do things.

984
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,280
The way they state something,

985
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,460
the way they code
a particular way,

986
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,900
the methodology of the attack,
the step-by-step approaches.

987
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,900
It might be considered
like Sherlock Holmesian

988
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,380
to come up with this idea.

989
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,770
"Because he walks
with a gait this way,

990
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,950
and he does this..."
But it is true.

991
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,260
We see those signatures.
We see those patterns.

992
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,000
What we discovered was,

993
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,440
by looking at the artefacts
that these attackers had used,

994
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,880
the malicious binaries
they had used,

995
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,180
the code inside of it,

996
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,750
as well as the email accounts
that they used

997
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,920
to send the initial
spear-phishing messages,

998
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,490
we were able to map this back
to an attacker back in 2014.

999
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,500
Sony Pictures is mainly housed
in Culver City.

1000
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
And in 2014,

1001
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,590
Sony Pictures went down,
which was unheard of.

1002
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,070
On that day in November,

1003
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,550
people would have come in,
tried to swipe their badge

1004
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,770
and not even be able
to get into the office.

1005
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,780
They get
into the building finally

1006
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,950
and then they discover that
nothing else is working either.

1007
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,000
Printers aren't working,
computers aren't working.

1008
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,220
People who had laptops
connected to the network

1009
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,960
would have immediately seen

1010
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,920
skulls and crossbones
show up on their screens,

1011
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,010
scrolling with scary
<i>Halloween</i>-type music

1012
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,490
playing in the background.

1013
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,710
And it said,
"Hacked by the GOP."

1014
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,980
Guardians of the Peace.

1015
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,020
A mysterious crew of hackers,

1016
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,980
also known as the Lazarus Group.

1017
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,120
We'd call them
the Lazarus Group.

1018
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,250
They've been responsible

1019
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,120
for many, many attacks
over the years.

1020
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,340
You know, political statements

1021
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,950
and bringing down some
websites in South Korea

1022
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,300
and also the White House in the
United States and the Pentagon.

1023
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,870
Now, at this point,
the penny has dropped.

1024
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,000
Sony has been hacked.

1025
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,660
The hack attack
has had a devastating effect

1026
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,490
on the entertainment company,
with an avalanche of leaks

1027
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,180
revealing personal information
of employees

1028
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,490
and salacious email exchanges
of A-list celebrities.

1029
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,500
They ultimately compromised
Sony Pictures Network,

1030
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,850
got inside
and wiped 10,000 computers.

1031
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,590
On top of that,
they actually stole

1032
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,680
all kinds of documents
and emails from Sony Pictures.

1033
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,810
The hack
on Sony Pictures

1034
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,380
is rocking Hollywood's
very foundation;

1035
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,030
the industry,
warts and all, exposed.

1036
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:59,250
Initially, we had no link
between the SWIFT attack

1037
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,950
and the Sony Pictures attack.

1038
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,480
But when we were looking
at the malware,

1039
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,390
we found an interesting detail.

1040
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,570
There was a component
called an indexing manager,

1041
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:13,010
which was saving the logs
during the SWIFT attack

1042
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,490
into an encrypted file.

1043
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,530
The file was encrypted
with a really long key,

1044
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,060
and when we just
googled for the key,

1045
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,280
we found that the same key, exactly,

1046
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,590
was used 18 months earlier
in the Sony Pictures attack.

1047
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,110
This was
the moment we realised

1048
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,070
the Bangladeshi SWIFT attack

1049
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,730
was probably perpetrated
by the Lazarus Group.

1050
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,300
So, who is Lazarus?

1051
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,780
Well, from what we know,

1052
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,740
they're a trans-global
criminal organisation

1053
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,570
that's been trained
at a nation-state level.

1054
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,440
The nation states really started
coming in on a criminal side...

1055
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,230
when sanctions started.

1056
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,270
When we start limiting
the capability of a nation

1057
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,410
to get cash, and we up
the methodology

1058
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,970
to monitor
the way they're getting cash,

1059
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,020
they turn to different approaches.

1060
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,890
So if you're a country
that's under sanction

1061
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:17,160
and your ability to get funds
has been compromised,

1062
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,120
you may be motivated to
go to the Lazarus Group

1063
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,420
to fix your problem.

1064
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,640
It's like a job for them.
It <i>is</i> a job for them.

1065
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,690
They get recruited.
It's a nine-to-five job.

1066
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,950
They come in, and each
of them has their specialties.

1067
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,350
They have managers,

1068
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,220
they have targets that
they're told to go after.

1069
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,350
When you talk about
nation states,

1070
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,610
obviously,
for your average nation state,

1071
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,920
most cyber offensive campaigns
are under the military.

1072
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,710
It's very similar to how
a military organisation

1073
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,020
would be organised for their
cyber offensive campaigns.

1074
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,450
There is a hotel,
for example, in China

1075
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,590
where they've taken over
multiple floors

1076
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,630
where they essentially
have dormitories.

1077
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,070
They go to sleep in that hotel,
they eat in that hotel,

1078
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,420
and they don't come
out of that hotel.

1079
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,070
They just move from
one room to another,

1080
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,860
hack all day and night.

1081
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,650
And the Lazarus Group
is thought to be made up

1082
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,390
of these state-trained hackers.

1083
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,220
What's amazing about cyber,

1084
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,790
when you talk about
nation states,

1085
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,310
is the cost to entry
is extremely low.

1086
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,710
We have nation states
who have been

1087
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,190
trying to create
nuclear missiles,

1088
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,060
tried to create
a nuclear programme.

1089
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,980
Places like Iran, for example.

1090
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,500
The dollars it costs to do so,
it's extraordinary.

1091
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,680
But if you want to build
a cyber offensive campaign,

1092
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,990
you get two, three,
four, five guys

1093
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:50,470
and potentially threaten
to disable the power grid

1094
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,030
in some country.

1095
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,470
When you talk about
trying to rob a bank

1096
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,170
or produce illicit drugs
and sell them,

1097
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,830
the amount of people
required on the ground,

1098
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,260
the amount of connections,

1099
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,440
and for the dollars
that you would receive,

1100
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,920
is nothing compared to,

1101
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,440
"Let's get three guys,
break into a bank

1102
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,660
and potentially
transfer $1 billion."

1103
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,500
Back in the VIP room
of the Solaire Casino in Manila,

1104
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,940
the money-laundering operation
is in full flight.

1105
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,720
They just spend hours
upon hours gambling away,

1106
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,290
collecting chips.

1107
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,730
They transfer those chips
back into cold, hard currency.

1108
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,690
You put a hundred
gamblers into the VIP lounge

1109
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,780
playing cash, so maybe the house
has a one or two percent margin.

1110
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,740
But all the rest is untraceable
money that they walk out with.

1111
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,000
What's interesting
about these individuals,

1112
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,700
they weren't interested
in winning.

1113
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,180
They were just interested
in playing.

1114
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,620
If you lose the money,

1115
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,400
the money doesn't go
to the casino,

1116
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,920
it goes to the other players.

1117
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,410
So you can play the table
where the other players are,

1118
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,840
your partners.

1119
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,190
Then you can lose
the dirty money on purpose,

1120
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,020
moving the money
to your partners.

1121
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,670
Now it's cashed out.

1122
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:09,070
Now it looks like it came from a
great win in a poker tournament

1123
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:11,640
instead of being stolen
from somewhere.

1124
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,510
So, casinos are a good way
of laundering money.

1125
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,340
Real-world criminals have
done that for decades.

1126
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:20,600
Online criminals
are doing it today.

1127
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,740
They played for a whole week,
that whole lunar week,

1128
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,690
every day, like workers,

1129
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,300
nine to five, essentially,
in that casino.

1130
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,360
Finally, the Chinese
New Year celebrations

1131
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,880
have come to an end.

1132
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,280
The staff at the RCBC bank
in Manila are back at work.

1133
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,320
Now, the Bangladesh Bank
is still desperately trying

1134
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,410
to put a stop
on any further withdrawals

1135
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,150
from those accounts
in the Bank of the Philippines.

1136
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:54,500
They've lost
$22 million already,

1137
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,810
but there's still $59 million
left that they can save.

1138
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:01,860
They're firing message
after message to Manila,

1139
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,730
"Hold all transactions."

1140
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,080
In the Philippines,
they got those messages.

1141
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,560
They got those messages

1142
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,830
as part of many other
transaction messages they got

1143
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,700
that were sitting in
a printer queue

1144
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,050
at the bottom of the stack,

1145
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,350
and ultimately, they never
saw those messages.

1146
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,790
At this point, the fence
gets in touch with the manager

1147
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,790
of the bank in Jupiter Street.

1148
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:26,670
"Can you please authorise
the transfer of $59 million?"

1149
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,840
She authorises that $59 million.

1150
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,110
It goes straight
to the Solaire Casino.

1151
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,020
More money laundering.

1152
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,420
Five hours later,

1153
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:44,030
after increasingly urgent calls
from the Bangladesh Bank,

1154
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:50,000
the manager finally puts a block
on all of the accounts.

1155
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,820
But, really, it's too late.

1156
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,830
The money's gone.

1157
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:02,270
It's incredible when you think
what the Lazarus Group

1158
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,880
was able to pull off with
just some ones and zeros.

1159
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,750
They guide their bespoke malware

1160
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:10,020
into the computer network
of a bank,

1161
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,710
and then a year later,

1162
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:15,020
they're literally washing
$100 million

1163
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,330
through a casino
in the Philippines.

1164
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,850
It's astonishing.

1165
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,330
But what's really, really scary

1166
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:25,680
is what happened
just a year later.

1167
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,560
Now back to
the major cyber-attack,

1168
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:34,080
the ransomware crippling 200,000
computers in 150 countries.

1169
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,690
The thousands of targets all
received this ominous message

1170
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,740
in English on their screens:

1171
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:54,150
Everyone was basically locked up
with this malware

1172
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:58,320
that we discovered had been
launched by the same attackers

1173
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,150
as the Central Bank
of Bangladesh.

1174
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,370
So they design this malware,

1175
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,980
and then they lose
control of it entirely.

1176
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,120
And that caused chaos.

1177
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,380
Ambulances were
diverted to other hospitals.

1178
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,820
Patients were turned away,
their operations cancelled.

1179
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,690
You know,
the first sign that something

1180
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:21,960
was seriously wrong was when
hospitals in the United Kingdom

1181
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,520
started telling patients,
"Don't come."

1182
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,530
That their systems had been
locked up with ransomware.

1183
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:33,620
It's unclear if it was
accidentally released too early,

1184
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,010
it appears so,

1185
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:37,890
or if it was
designed not to work

1186
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:41,240
and just begin wiping computers,
because it didn't matter.

1187
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,150
Even if you paid them, you would
not get the decryption key.

1188
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,980
They didn't have
the decryption key.

1189
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,110
They couldn't decrypt your files anymore.

1190
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,810
Japan, Turkey
and the Philippines

1191
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:54,730
were also affected.
In the US, FedEx was hit.

1192
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:59,690
That virulent virus
spiralled out of control.

1193
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:04,040
In Germany, it attacked the
network of the Deutsche Bahn,

1194
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,430
German Railway.

1195
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:09,400
In Spain,
WannaCry hit Telefonica,

1196
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,350
the biggest telecommunications company.

1197
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:16,530
It hit the banking systems,
and ATMs didn't work.

1198
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:21,840
This thing was hitting companies
in something like 150 countries.

1199
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,580
Other targets in the US

1200
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,020
include Merck Pharmaceutical
in New Jersey.

1201
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,810
Even the company that makes
Oreo cookies may have been hit.

1202
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:32,940
So, you had the health
service, you had transport,

1203
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,470
you had communications,
you had the finance system,

1204
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:37,900
and you had governance

1205
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:42,820
all with one tiny piece
of crappy malware, WannaCry.

1206
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,130
In other attacks,

1207
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,000
they have to send you
a spear-phishing email,

1208
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,040
trick you into double-clicking
on an attachment.

1209
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,180
In this case, your computer
just had to be on,

1210
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,480
connected to the internet,

1211
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,050
and it would have got infected
by WannaCry.

1212
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:57,270
It succeeded because
the crappy malware

1213
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:00,400
was being infiltrated
into the systems

1214
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,190
on the back
of a much more powerful tool

1215
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,800
called EternalBlue,

1216
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,450
which had been developed by
the National Security Agency

1217
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,410
in the United States.

1218
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:12,630
The thing the NSA
never wanted to talk about

1219
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:15,640
was the fact that it was
travelling on a digital missile

1220
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,420
that had been built
at its own intelligence agency.

1221
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:22,560
They repurposed something
created by the US government,

1222
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,170
leaked
by the Russian government,

1223
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,820
put it into their ransomware
that allowed it to spread

1224
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:30,740
all over the world,
any computer on at that time.

1225
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:34,000
So one crappy piece
of malware

1226
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,870
can hit every single aspect

1227
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:39,140
of the critical national infrastructure

1228
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,970
within the space
of about ten days

1229
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,880
in different countries.

1230
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,720
Eventually, there's a court case
after about a month.

1231
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,600
There's a court case in Manila.

1232
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,900
Ultimately, the bank manager
didn't want anyone to find out.

1233
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,380
But when he finally got in touch

1234
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,820
with the Bank
of the Philippines, they said,

1235
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,820
"If you need this money returned,

1236
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,700
you need to get a court order."
So he files a court order,

1237
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,000
but court orders are public
in the Philippines,

1238
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,570
like in many other countries.

1239
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:22,570
A reporter spots it and realised
that this has happened,

1240
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,100
publishes it in a newspaper,
and it all comes out.

1241
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,010
The $81 million
money-laundering scandal

1242
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:31,670
is now considered one of
the biggest bank heists in Asia.

1243
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:33,800
But how exactly
did thieves steal

1244
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,980
such a huge amount of money?

1245
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,460
Not just known
in the Philippines

1246
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,670
and the Bank of Bangladesh,

1247
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,370
when the Bangladesh
government finds out

1248
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,900
the bank manager has been
doing this behind the scenes,

1249
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,330
but the whole world finds out.

1250
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,770
And ultimately,
the Bangladesh Bank

1251
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,860
needs to get assistance
from the FBI.

1252
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:52,170
The New York Fed is involved.
The United States is involved.

1253
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,300
This becomes
a whole worldwide issue

1254
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:57,220
and begins to ripple across
the financial industry

1255
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,740
that this was even possible.

1256
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,520
Experts believe that hackers

1257
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,180
were able to break into the
New York Federal Reserve's

1258
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,400
special account for Bangladesh,

1259
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,750
getting away with $81 million.

1260
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,230
Now, Bangladesh's Central Bank
governor, Atiur Rahman,

1261
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:16,930
has resigned after hackers stole
tens of millions of dollars

1262
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,190
from the nation's
foreign reserves.

1263
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:23,150
The bank was criticised for
its handling of the breach...

1264
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:26,160
The governor was
an excellent central banker.

1265
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,900
I have a lot of respect for him.

1266
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:32,290
He was deemed one of the top
bankers by the Asia <i>MoneyWeek.</i>

1267
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,120
And poor fellow, that time,

1268
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,730
he was faced with
this sort of scenario

1269
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:39,820
which he honestly
didn't understand.

1270
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,780
He had really pushed
the financial system

1271
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:45,520
in Bangladesh into
the 21st century.

1272
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,570
He had to essentially fall
on his sword and resign

1273
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:51,400
in disgrace,
and his career was ruined.

1274
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,190
Many others at the bank
had to resign as well.

1275
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,750
An emotional Maia Deguito,
the manager of the RCBC branch

1276
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:01,150
in Jupiter Street in Makati,
insists she is innocent

1277
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:02,760
in the face of accusations

1278
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,630
she is involved in the
money-laundering scheme.

1279
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:08,240
So far, only the branch manager

1280
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,460
has been charged by the
Anti-Money Laundering Council.

1281
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,380
One of the great
injustices of this whole scandal

1282
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,340
is that the only person who
got convicted of anything

1283
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,950
was Maia Deguito,

1284
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:22,690
and she was just the mid-level
branch manager of the RCBC,

1285
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:26,870
the bank in the Philippines
that received the actual funds.

1286
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:28,180
Typical, isn't it?

1287
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,960
A crime that was conceived
and carried out

1288
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,400
by a whole bunch of men,

1289
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,530
and the only person who
gets done for it is a woman

1290
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:38,530
who probably wasn't that
guilty in the first place.

1291
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:41,800
But she received a sentence
of 56 years in jail

1292
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,970
and a fine of $109 million,

1293
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:49,500
which is significantly more
than the thieves actually stole.

1294
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,290
To my mind,

1295
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,420
there's no question
that she was a scapegoat.

1296
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,290
I mean, the currency traders
who turned that $81 million

1297
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,300
into pesos got off scot-free.

1298
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,730
There are a couple of
Chinese operators

1299
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:06,560
who brought these gamblers
in from China.

1300
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,390
We know that they received tens
of millions of dollars in cash.

1301
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:15,310
They vanished back to Macau.
No trace of them was ever found.

1302
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,750
We can't say for sure,
but certainly it looks like

1303
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,790
people at the Rizal Bank headquarters

1304
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,880
buried these requests
to stop these transactions.

1305
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,230
But nobody else at the Rizal
Bank was ever accused.

1306
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:31,190
Oddly enough, in this giant
scheme that involved

1307
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:34,980
a half a dozen countries,
nearly $1 billion,

1308
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:40,200
only one bank employee
in a small branch in Manila

1309
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,640
was ever convicted of
doing anything wrong.

1310
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,040
It's incredible. Total impunity.

1311
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,780
I think the most
important lesson

1312
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,870
of the Bangladesh Bank

1313
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,880
is a lesson of scale.

1314
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,880
The internet is
a fantastic thing.

1315
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,320
It's made our world
much, much smaller.

1316
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,060
You can do all sorts of things.
It's fantastic.

1317
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,930
But that interconnectivity,

1318
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,800
where everything
is linked to everything else,

1319
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,410
means that if you get bad actors
in that system,

1320
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,240
then the damage

1321
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:22,070
is infinitely more immense
than it was before.

1322
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,990
When I started this job
two decades ago,

1323
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:29,080
you had to explain to people,
what is a virus?

1324
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,040
What is a cyber-attack?

1325
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,390
Today, we don't talk about

1326
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,430
making sure this file doesn't
get deleted any more.

1327
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:40,570
We literally talk about making
sure the supply chain is up,

1328
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,610
food can reach people's tables.

1329
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:45,660
Our job is not just to protect
people's computers.

1330
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,060
Our job is to ensure
society is up and running.

1331
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:52,060
Everything
that we use now,

1332
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,970
water, electricity,

1333
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,930
the financial system,
the comms system,

1334
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,540
depends on the integrity

1335
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:03,680
of unbelievably complex
networked computer systems.

1336
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,990
And our dependence
is becoming such

1337
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,380
that, should anything go wrong,

1338
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,170
be it a technical hitch
or be it a hack,

1339
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:17,130
it can actually lead
to our lives grinding to a halt

1340
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,520
in a very short space of time.

1341
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,130
We're sort of in a state

1342
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,610
where we're increasing
our vulnerability

1343
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,350
and our attack surface
every single day.

1344
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:29,790
And instead of pausing

1345
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:32,790
and thinking about
how to lock up our power grid,

1346
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:37,840
really, where our energy has
been focused is on escalation.

1347
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,370
Countries like the United
States, China and Russia

1348
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:44,550
have already arrogated
the right to themselves

1349
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,330
to attack with full force,

1350
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:50,030
whether cyber
or conventional weapons,

1351
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,900
against anyone who brings down

1352
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,510
a serious piece of critical
national infrastructure.

1353
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:01,480
We've had Stuxnet blowing
up the Natanz centrifuge plant.

1354
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,960
We've had ransomware attacks,
which hit the Eastern Seaboard.

1355
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,000
There was no gas
to the Eastern Seaboard

1356
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,610
for a whole week
in the United States.

1357
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,750
We had Russia
against the Ukraine,

1358
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,530
shutting out the power
in the middle of winter.

1359
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:17,450
We're talking about
people losing their lives.

1360
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,010
We've also had cyber-attacks

1361
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:21,410
that potentially affected
US elections.

1362
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,760
We had the healthcare in the UK
brought down,

1363
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,930
dialysis machines
no longer working.

1364
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:29,420
This is an extremely
fragile situation,

1365
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,590
much more fragile
than the period of détente,

1366
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:37,250
because so many more
countries have these weapons.

1367
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:41,380
Malware is much more difficult
to control than nuclear weapons.

1368
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,870
People always warn me
of the cyber Pearl Harbor

1369
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:47,090
or the cyber 9/11,

1370
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,740
but it's almost worse than that.

1371
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:53,610
Every day, there are thousands
of cyber-attacks,

1372
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:58,230
and we're just getting more and
more and more inured to them.

1373
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,880
It's like a plague.

1374
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,150
I think we'll see much
more hostile cyber activity,

1375
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:07,850
much more cyber bank robberies,

1376
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,980
much more cyber espionage.

1377
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,030
We'll see much more cyber war.

1378
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,810
In many ways,
I think we've seen nothing yet.

1379
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,250
As attacks increase
in their sophistication

1380
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,380
and their range,

1381
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:25,340
then the impact
can be ever greater.

1382
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:29,870
There is a cyber-attack on
critical national infrastructure

1383
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,740
coming to a place near you

1384
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,260
within the next
five to ten years.

1385
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:38,700
If it's done well,
and if it's really malicious,

1386
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,230
that could be catastrophic.

1387
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:47,580
What's amazing about the
Bank of Bangladesh heist is...

1388
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:51,280
they almost walked away
with $1 billion.

1389
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:56,200
The mistakes that they made

1390
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,990
that led to them only walking
with $81 million

1391
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:02,860
were literally a typo in a name

1392
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,080
and potentially
not being patient enough,

1393
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,560
waiting just one more hour.

1394
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,910
We could be telling
a completely different story.

1395
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,820
Presumably, these guys

1396
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,300
kept perhaps 95 percent
of that cash.

1397
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,520
You could walk out

1398
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,390
with 95 percent
of what you came in with,

1399
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,830
have nobody trace that money,
no record of it whatsoever,

1400
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:26,230
and get on a plane with it,
and you're home free.

1401
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:30,760
Even if you had invested
a year's work,

1402
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:35,460
that you had recruited
a really decent set of hackers,

1403
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,890
that you had corrupted
bank officials,

1404
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,940
you'll be looking at a profit
of about $75 million.

1405
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,030
For a year's work,
not a bad pay-off.

1406
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,990
The Bank of Bangladesh heist
showed them what was possible.

1407
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,740
They proved that
they could do it.

1408
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,660
After that attack,
it didn't stop.

1409
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:07,840
We saw continued attacks
on various banks across Asia,

1410
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,450
I think in
the Philippines again.

1411
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:14,670
And also, they started hacking
the cryptocurrency exchanges,

1412
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:18,540
where people store their Bitcoin
and Monero digital currency,

1413
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:21,720
which has proved to be
incredibly lucrative for them.

1414
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,680
In 2017,
Lazarus was thought

1415
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,330
to have successfully attacked

1416
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:31,990
at least five Asian
cryptocurrency exchanges.

1417
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:37,820
That's a total of
$571 million that was lost.

1418
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,130
Cryptocurrency exchanges
just have the bare minimum

1419
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,650
of security, we're learning now.

1420
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:46,920
In 2020, as the global
pandemic spiralled,

1421
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,140
AstraZeneca, makers of
one of the key vaccines,

1422
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:53,530
was hit by an attack,
extorting the company

1423
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:56,840
and stealing sensitive
information for profit.

1424
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,630
The sums involved
are astronomical,

1425
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:03,940
and Lazarus is still
very much at large.

1426
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:11,770
They have been designated
by the United States an APT;

1427
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,860
that's an
advanced persistent threat.

1428
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,690
Now, the fundamental criteria

1429
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,470
is that they represent a threat

1430
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:24,610
to US national security
and national infrastructure.

1431
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:28,480
So, just by dint of it
being called an APT

1432
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,400
means that the Lazarus Group
is serious stuff.

1433
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,620
Marvel fans,
think HYDRA.

1434
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,800
James Bond films,
think of SPECTRE.

1435
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,230
It's something like that.

1436
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,630
Now, it's tempting to
think this comparison is absurd,

1437
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:51,070
but this is the scale
that Lazarus operates on.

1438
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:54,290
Arguably, they're the most
potent cyber criminals

1439
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,420
in business today.

1440
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:00,300
So the nation state's
involvement in cybercrime

1441
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,950
means that cybercrime
has actually morphed

1442
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:05,650
into cyber warfare.

1443
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:08,610
You can have zero trust
in these systems.

1444
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:12,090
You need to assume that
everything has been broken,

1445
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,010
everything is being listened to,

1446
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:17,270
that everything can be captured,
and operate accordingly.

1447
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:22,450
If a small group
can plan something

1448
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:25,490
and get away with $81 million,

1449
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:27,930
which involved
the Fed in New York,

1450
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,760
SWIFT in Brussels,

1451
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,550
the Bangladeshi Bank in Dhaka,

1452
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:36,030
and then all the peripherals
in Manila,

1453
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:40,420
just think about what one of the
really professional operations

1454
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,560
in China, Russia,

1455
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,510
the NSA, GCHQ,

1456
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:48,870
just think what havoc
they could wreak.

1457
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:52,610
And every year, the hacks get
bigger, the damage greater,

1458
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:54,700
the implications graver.

1459
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:00,440
Armies literally have hackers
hammering at the gates.

1460
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,710
And it just takes
a simple breach,

1461
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:05,580
one person, one weak link,

1462
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,230
and those armies
will storm the defences

1463
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:12,850
and bring down a network
that our way of life depends on.

1464
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,590
It happened in Bangladesh
in 2016.

1465
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:21,030
And believe you me, it's going
to happen again very soon.

1466
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,910
